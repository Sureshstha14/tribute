    Helen Adams Keller (June 27, 1880 â€“ 
    June 1, 1968) was an American author
    , disability rights advocate, 
    political activist and lecturer.
     Born in West Tuscumbia, Alabama, 
     she lost her sight and hearing after 
     a bout of illness at the age of nineteen months. She then communicated primarily using home signs until the age of seven when she met her first teacher and life-long companion Anne Sullivan, who taught her language, including reading and writing; Sullivan's first lessons involved spelling words on Keller's hand to show her the names of objects around her. She also learned how to speak and to understand other people's speech using the Tadoma method. After an education at both specialist and mainstream schools, she attended Radcliffe College of Harvard University and became the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. She worked for the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) from 1924 until 1968, during which time she toured the United States and traveled to 39 countries around the globe advocating for those with vision loss.

        <p>Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.</p>
        <p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.</p>
        <p>Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.
            </p><p>
                </p><p>Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadows.</p>
                <p>Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.</p>
                <p>Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement</p>
                <p>Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.</p>
                <p>When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.</p>
                <p>The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.</p>
                <p>Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.</p>
                <p>What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us.</p>
